## Inspiration

It's a story everyone knows: you're stuck in traffic or walking home, and you feel like you could be _doing_ something. But it's hard when you barely lack the attention to read a book or even listen to a podcast. What _can_ you do?

In comes Banter.

## Dependencies

An OpenAI API key is needed - store it in `Backend/key`.

To start the backend, do `python3 main.py` while in `Backend/`. (Certain libraries may need to be imported.)

To start the frontend, do `npm run build` while in `frontend/`.
