	The basic vector space

	We shall denote by R the field of real numbers. Then we shall use the Cartesian product
R N equal to R by R by R and so on n times, of ordered n-tuples of real numbers (n factors). Typical notation for
x in R N will be
x equal to x1 comma x2 comma x3 and so on, up to xn.

	Here x is called a point or a vector, and x1, x2, and so on, are called the coordinates of x. The
natural number n is called the dimension of the space. Often when speaking about R N and
its vectors, real numbers are called scalars.

	Here are some special notations.

	In R1, a point is just a real number x.

	In R2,  x is equal to x1 comma  x2 or p is equal to x comma  y

	In R3, x is equal to  x1 comma  x2 comma  x3  or p is equal to  x comma  y comma  z .



	We define algebraic operations as follows: for x, y in R N and a in R,
x  plus  y  equals   x1  plus  y1 comma  x2  plus  y2 comma  and so on  comma  xn  plus   Y N  ;
 A X   equals    A X 1 comma   A X 2 comma  and so on  comma   A X n ;
 negative x  equals    negative 1)x  equals  ( negative x1 comma   negative x2 comma  and so on  comma   negative xn ;
x  minus  y  equals  x  plus    negative y)  equals  (x1  minus  y1 comma  x2  minus  y2 comma  and so on  comma  xn  minus   Y N  .

	We also define the origin (AKA the point zero)
0  equals   0 comma  0 comma  and so on  comma  0 .
(Notice that 0 on the left side is a vector, though we use the same notation as for the scalar
0.)

	Then we have the easy facts:
x  plus  y  equals  y  plus  x;
adding x + y to z is the same as adding x to y plus z;
0  plus  x  equals  x;
x  minus  x  equals  0;
1x  equals  x;
multiplying a times b with x  is the same as multiplying  a with b times x;
the product of a with x  plus  y  equals   A X   plus   A Y ;
the product of a  plus  b with x  equals   A X   plus  bx;
0x  equals  0;
a0  equals  0.

in other words all the
 “usual” algebraic rules
 are valid if they make
  sense

	Thinking in physical schematics can be very helpful. One nice example is concerned with the line
determined by x and y (distinct points in R N). This line by definition is the set of all points
of the form
1  minus  t, quantity times x, plus  ty, where t in R.

	Imagine pinching a very thin rod between your fingers on each hand. Say your right hand is x and your right hand is y. Each point on the rod is represented by a different value of t. If t equals 0, the corresponding point is in your right hand. T equals one half is the midpoint between your hands. T equals one is your left hand. T equals two is some point off to the left of your left hand, and t eqauls negative one is some point off to the right of your right hand.

	This physical representation really is more than just schematic, as the line is basically a 1-dimensional
object, even though it is located as a subset of n-dimensional space. In addition, the closed
line segment with end points x and y consists of all points as above, but with 0  less than or equal to  t  less than or equal to  1. This
segment is the bit of the rod between your hands in the physical representation. We denote this segment by  bracket x y .

	We now see right away the wonderful interplay between algebra and geometry, something
that will occur frequently in this book. Namely, the points on the above line can be described
completely in terms of the algebraic formula given for the line. On the other hand, the line is
of course a geometric object.

	It is very important to get comfortable with this sort of interplay. For instance, if we
happen to be discussing points in R5, we probably have very little in our background that
gives us geometric insight to the nature of R5. However, the algebra for a line in R5 is very
simple, and the geometry of a line is just like the geometry of R1.

	Similarly, it is helpful to represent triangles with a physical representation in the plane of the page. Thus
if we have three noncollinear points x, y, z in R N, there is a unique plane which contains them.
This plane lies in R N of course, but restricting attention to it gives a physical representation that looks like
an ordinary plane. The plane is the set of all points of the form
p  equals  t1x  plus  t2y  plus  t3z,
where t1  plus  t2  plus  t3  equals  1. Sometimes the scalars t1, t2, t3 are called barycentric coordinates of
the point p.


	 1 dash 1. We need to examine the word collinear we have just used. In fact,
prove that three points x, y, z in R N lie on a line  if and only if  there exist scalars t1, t2, t3, not all
zero, such that
t1  plus  t2  plus  t3  equals  0, and
t1x  plus  t2y  plus  t3z  equals  0.

	 1 dash 2. Prove that x, y, 0 are collinear  if and only if  x is a scalar multiple of y or y
is a scalar multiple of x.

	 1 dash 3. Prove that if x, y, z in R N are not collinear and if p belongs to the
plane they determine, then the real numbers t1, t2, t3 such that
t1  plus  t2  plus  t3  equals  1, and
t1x  plus  t2y  plus  t3z  equals  p,
are unique.


	As an example of our method of viewing triangles, think about an equilateral triangle. If
we imagine it conveniently placed in R2, the coordinates of the vertices are bound to be rather
complicated; for instance, here are two ways:0 comma  1
 negative   three halves  comma   negative  one half    three halves  comma  negative  one half 
x2
x1
1 comma  0 minus 1 comma  0
0 comma  3 
x2
x1

	But a really elegant positioning is available in R3, if we simply place the vertices at  1 comma  0 comma  0 ,
 0 comma  1 comma  0  and  0 comma  0 comma  1 :
6 Chapter 1 0 comma  0 comma  1 
 0 comma  1 comma  0 
 1 comma  0 comma  0 

	Now this looks much better if we view this triangle as it lies in the plane x1  plus  x2  plus  x3  equals  1:
We can’t draw coordinate axes in this plane, or even the origin, though we could imagine the
origin as sitting “behind” the centroid:origin


	 1 dash 6. Prove that the four points w, x, y, z in R N are coplanar  if and only if  there
exist real numbers t1, t2, t3, t4, not all zero, such that
t1  plus  t2  plus  t3  plus  t4  equals  0,
t1w  plus  t2x  plus  t3y  plus  t4z  equals  0.

	As further evidence of the power of vector algebra in solving simple problems in geometry,
we offer

	 1 dash 7. Let us say that four distinct points w, x, y, z in R N define a
quadrilateral , whose sides are the segments  bracket w x ,  bracket x y ,  bracket y z ,  bracket z w  in that order.w
z
y
x
y z
x
w
Prove that the four midpoints of the sides of a quadrilateral, taken in order, form the
vertices of a parallelogram (which might be degenerate). In particular, these four points
are coplanar. (Note that the original quadrilateral need not lie in a plane.) Express the
center of this parallelogram in terms of the points w, x , y , and z.


	 1 dash 8. We have seen in Problem 1 dash 1 the idea of three points being collinear,
and in Problem 1 dash 6 the idea of four points being coplanar. These definitions can of course
be generalized to an arbitrary number of points. In particular, give the correct analogous
definition for two points to be (say) “copunctual” and then prove the easy result that two
points are “copunctual” if and only if they are equal.

	 1 dash 9. Give a careful proof that any three points in R1 are collinear; and
also that any four points in R2 are coplanar.

	It is certainly worth a comment that we expect three “random” points in R2 to be non-
collinear. We would then say that the three points are in general position. Likewise, four
points in R3 are in general position if they are not coplanar.
